Tamagotchi Game
----------------
This project is a game that begins with a plant-like creature on the user's screen. The user starts the game after naming the creature/pet. When the game starts, every 5 seconds the stats; hungry, boredness, and tired increase by 1. The user must decrease the stats by pressing any of the buttons below the stats. If the user does not make it in time to lower the state before hitting "10" on any of the three, the game alerts the user that they have lost. In addition, the pet morphs 2 times after its inital appearance at age 5 and 10.

Biggest challenges:
Some of my code is repetitive and I could have used a for loop in the function addToStat()
I initally tried a for loop but had a hard time figuring out how to permanently update the innerhtml as I was only able to change the value in variables tamagotchi.hungry, tamagotchi.boredness and tamagotchi.sleepiness. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biggest Triumphs:
I initially had issues with getting my start button to return a value to me, I found out that addeventlistener can't retrieve a value that easily and in order to be able to I had to access the object to get the data outside the button.
